## Description

Minishell is about creating a simple shell, like **bash** or **zsh**.

## Goals

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell. And through that, to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

## Mandatory

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or unspecified special characters like **\\** or **;**.

• Not use more than one global variable.

• Show a prompt when waiting for a new command.

• Have a working History.

• Search and launch the right executable.

• It must implement **echo**, **cd**, **pwd**, **export**, **unset**, **env** and **exit**.

• Redirections, Pipes and Environment variables.

• **CTRL+C** and **CTRL+D**

## Bonus

• &&, || with parenthesis for priorities.

• The wildcard * should work for the current working directory.
